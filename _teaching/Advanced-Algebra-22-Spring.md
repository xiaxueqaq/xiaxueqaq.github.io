I served as a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Algebra II taught by Prof. Yufeng Zhao in the 2022 Spring semester. I graded exercises and exam papers and I also taught a series of lessons on advanced algebra problem solving. The lecture notes are available at [here](https://github.com/xiaxueqaq/Advanced_Algebra_II_notes).
