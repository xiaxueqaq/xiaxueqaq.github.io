I served as a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Algebra II taught by [Prof. Wenwei Li](https://www.wwli.asia/index.php/en/) in the 2023 Spring semester. I graded exercises and exam papers and I also taught a series of lessons on advanced algebra problem solving. The lecture notes are available at [here](https://github.com/xiaxueqaq/Advanced_Algebra_II_notes).
