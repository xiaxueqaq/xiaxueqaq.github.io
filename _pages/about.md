I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Mathematics at Peking University (PKU). My advisor is [Prof. Bican Xia](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/xiabc/html/index_en.html). 

I obtained my bachelor's degree from Hua Loo-Keng honorary class, School of Mathematical Sciences, Beihang University (BUAA). 


My research interest lies in the intersection of 

  1. Algebraic Geometry
  2. Mathematical Logic
  3. Theorectical Computer Sciences

For example, given a semi-algebraic set / an algebraic variety $X$ (algebraic geometry), described by a logic formula (logic), I would like to know how can I decide whether $X$ is empty (TCS)?

As another example, given a semi-algebraic set / an algebraic variety $X$, how can I compute its projection image in the low-dimensional space (Quantifier Elimination)? 

You may refer to [my recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10515) on a new CAD algorithm to see my research interest in more details.


I will be graduating in July 2026 and I am on the job market now. Right now I am looking for a post-doc position. Please [let me know](mailto:xiaxueqaq@stu.pku.edu.cn) if there are available fundings.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV_Chen.pdf).
