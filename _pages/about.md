I am a third-year PhD candidate in Mathematics at Peking University (PKU). My advisor is [Prof. Bican Xia](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/xiabc/html/index_en.html). 

I obtained my bachelor's degree from Hua Loo-Keng honorary class, School of Mathematical Sciences, Beihang University (BUAA). 

My research interest includes computational algebraic geometry, cylindrical algebraic decomposition, symbolic computation and computability.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf).
