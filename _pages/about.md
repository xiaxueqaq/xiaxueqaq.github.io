I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Mathematics at Peking University (PKU). My advisor is [Prof. Bican Xia](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/xiabc/html/index_en.html). I obtained my bachelor's degree from Hua Loo-Keng honorary class, School of Mathematical Sciences, Beihang University (BUAA). 

My research interest includes computational algebraic geometry, real algebraic geometry, symbolic computation and theoretical computer science. You may refer to [my recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10515) on a geometric approach to cylindrical algebraic decomposition to see my research interest in more details.

I will be graduating in July 2026 and I am on the job market now. Right now I am looking for a post-doc position. Please [let me know](mailto:xiaxueqaq@stu.pku.edu.cn) if there are available fundings.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV_Chen.pdf).
