I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Mathematics at Peking University (PKU). My advisor is [Prof. Bican Xia](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/xiabc/html/index_en.html). 

I obtained my bachelor's degree from Hua Loo-Keng honorary class, School of Mathematical Sciences, Beihang University (BUAA). 

My research interest includes computational algebraic geometry, cylindrical algebraic decomposition, symbolic computation and computability.

Right now I am looking for visiting opportunities and I will come with my own fund, please let me know if you are interested! Currently my focus is mainly on real algebraic geometry (both theoretical side and computational side). So there is a high chance that we can find some topic fun to do.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV_Chen.pdf).
