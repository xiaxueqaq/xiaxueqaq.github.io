title: "Reduction of Transcendental Decision Problems over the Reals"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/issac-24
excerpt: 'This paper shows that reduction can be widely performed in a class of problems called "Trigonometric Extension", which generalizes our previous result. Some new decidability results, including a special kind of reachability problem, are derived from the reduction (conditional on Schanuel's Conjecture).'
