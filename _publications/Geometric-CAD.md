title: "A Geometric Approach to Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Geometric-CAD
excerpt: 'This paper is about the geometry behind the cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD, a classical construction in real algebraic geometry). We show that this construction is related to studying finite free (flat) morphisms of real varieties and present a new algorithm for CAD.'
