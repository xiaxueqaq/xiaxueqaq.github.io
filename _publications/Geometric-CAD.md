title: "Geometric Fiber Classification of Morphisms and a Geometric Approach to Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Geometric-CAD
excerpt: 'This paper is about the geometry behind the cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD, a classical construction in real algebraic geometry). We show that this construction is related to the geometric fiber cardinality classification in algebraic geometry and present a new algorithm for CAD.'
