title: "What Kind of Morphisms Induces Covering Maps over a Real Closed Field?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/covering-map
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a new family of morphisms between varieties, namely the q-\'etale morphisms (= flat + finitely and constantly many geometric points in fibers). It is shown in the paper that q-\'etale morphisms become finite \'etale after reduction, therefore induce covering maps on the real points for real varieties.'
